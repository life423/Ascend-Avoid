@workspace fix all the typescript errors

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the TypeScript errors in your workspace. Let me first check for any TypeScript errors in the current file and other files in the workspace. Let me check for TypeScript errors across multiple key files: Let me check for errors in more files, including the server-side TypeScript files: Let me check for errors in some of the manager and entity files: Let me check for errors in the UI and system files: Let me check for errors in the remaining core files and utils: It looks like I've found only one TypeScript error in the workspace - the unused `entries` parameter in the `responsiveCanvas.ts` file. Let me fix this error: 
```

```
Now let me verify that the error has been fixed: Perfect! Let me run a comprehensive TypeScript check to make sure there are no other errors by running the TypeScript compiler: I found many TypeScript errors! Let me fix them systematically, starting with the most critical ones:

1. First, let me fix the `TouchControls.ts` interface issue: Let me read more context: 
```

```
2. Now let me fix the issue around line 495 in TouchControls.ts: The `this.container` check looks fine. Let me look at where the `never` type issue might be coming from: Let me check the constructor and how the container is initialized: 
```

```
I need to handle the null container properly throughout the file. Let me fix these issues: 
```

```
Let me fix the other container references: 
```

```
I made a syntax error. Let me fix it by reading the file around that area: I need to properly close the bracket. Let me fix this: 
```

```
Now let me fix the remaining container issue around line 495: The issue seems to be that TypeScript is getting confused about the type. Let me fix this by adding a type assertion or ensuring the container type is properly handled: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Let me check the current TypeScript errors to see what's left: Let me fix these issues one by one. First, let me read the context around line 477: I see the issue - the formatting got messed up. Let me fix it: 
```

```
I've created a mess with the syntax. Let me read the file around that area and fix it properly: I see there's a formatting issue with line 469. Let me fix it: 
```

```
Good, now let me fix the line 540 issue. Let me find that line: The issue might be with the TypeScript understanding the type of container after the null check. Let me add a type assertion: 
```

```
I see there's a formatting issue again. Let me read more context: 
```

```
Let me read more context to understand the structure: 
```

```
Let me look at a wider context to understand the method structure: I see the issue - there's still formatting problems. Let me fix the whole show() method: 
```

```
Now let me remove the unused property and fix any remaining issues: 
```

```
Let me remove the references to restartControl: Let me find and remove the restartControl references: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me check the errors to see what's left: Great! Now let me move on to fix other TypeScript errors. Let me fix the Game.ts errors: 
```

```
Now let me fix the type issue around line 230. Let me read that area: The issue might be with the type mismatch between the `Game` interface and the default export class. Let me check if there's a Game interface defined: Let me check if there's a separate interface or type definition: Let me look at what the ResponsiveManager constructor expects: Let me look for the constructor: Let me check what `Game` type is imported: I need to check where the Game type is imported from: Let me look for the Game type definition in ResponsiveManager: Let me check if there's a forward declaration or if Game is defined elsewhere: I see! There's a local Game interface in ResponsiveManager that's causing the conflict. The actual Game class has more properties. Let me update the interface to be more permissive: 
```

```
Now let me fix the unused variable issue in `Game.ts` around line 879: 
```

```
Now let me fix the GameConfig.ts unused variable: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

```

```
Let me remove those references too: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me fix some unused imports. Let me fix GameModes.ts: 
```

```
Let me fix these unused variables/interfaces: 
```

```
Let me fix the comment block properly: 
```

```
Now let me fix the unused inputChangeCount: 
```

```
Now let me fix the unused parameters by using underscore prefix: 
```

```

Let me check the MultiplayerMode.ts file for similar issues: Let me continue with other files. Let me check for the unused imports:
